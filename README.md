# final_project_MoeWolf

## Part 1

### [Outline] For this project, I decided to focus on how the hand you're dealt in life can affect your health. Specifically, I want to focus on the connection between obesity and poverty. If other data presents itself, such as smoking rates, I may include that later. I will then show the reader that the government needs to help people by making healthy choices easier and removing monetary incentives from companies that benefit from making our population unhealthy. Maps showing this correlation are on the shorthand preview I included below. I plan on creating maps that are more harmonious in order to show the realtionship more seamlessly. 

### [Data] I plan to use the United States Physical Activity and Obesity Prevalence by County 2001-2011 data from [Healthdata.org](http://ghdx.healthdata.org/record/ihme-data/united-states-physical-activity-and-obesity-prevalence-county-2001-2011) for the obesity measure and poverty status in the past twelve months data from [Census.gov](https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/download_center.xhtml)

### [Sketches & Medium] I plan to implement my final project by creating graphs showing the realtionship in various areas and talking about research that has shown that food deserts, low income, stresss, and the like can negatively affect your health. The majority of the work will be map data that I have pulled together from the aforementioned data sources though. I plan on presenting this over shorthand. I created a very brief mock-up here - [Shorthand Preview](https://preview.shorthand.com/7rNvL5A4Mob1zrmf)

## Part 2

I continued to pursue this story, but I found better data to support it at [DataUSA.io](Copy of Data USA Cart.csv). 
I originally intended to tell this story through various maps, the data was all aggregated on the county level, so that kind of just made sense to me. However, after fiddling around with it for a while, I asked some people how it looked, and realized that it wasn't as descriptive as I imagined it would be. Here is an example of a [map](Map.pdf) I made at this stage. It's a little too cluttered and the relationships just don't stand out. 

### user research protocol: 
* target audience I hope to reach
  * Healthcare Professionals
* Approach to identifying representative individuals to interview
  * Talk to doctors, nurses, and other healthcare professionals I know
* Interview script/findings

I created a [Google Form](https://forms.gle/G5bwPHUaoP8Z5A6QA) for my interview subjects to fill out. The questions were as follows:
1. Why do you think poor people or minorities in the US are out of shape or have lifestyle diseases (heart conditions, lung disease, diabetes, etc)?
2. Do you think these people bear responsibility for the health conditions they have?
3. Do you understand these graphs? What do you like/not like about them? ![Graph 1](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/Faitze2aC7zlBoVQlVbE4PVAimNXOkAuE3VW-aN1cKZKPUhy6RUxOFM1BFoj7uW1aOkqy5wpUo7rKJGn2hntimSpP9wBVakjlRTMGuJSr85LfpVmFbihIu_I8RkS=w740) ![Graph 2](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/JO7M5ew4ayTqA2zKxydSdv3Gyu_LKwYX26M4nZy0Jb9EAFvzTM00s2LFW0mkHyfn6MMShJmmKdkBcfjdYYmIzYMt2T90bSp6rhmkHa91EGMH9BbAif2KAJDyRAef=w740)

4. Do you understand this story outline? What do you like/not like about it? ![Outline](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/BGuJDlgc_ZDQpaTMKBvyAic2i-ADcvVTgd_OifV_IMlDJT6PZRO2ctjv6E1z1SsnEQurCESoHo9h08jwfBCP9NIqrdfySTKLUGoQhrU3AbKfZ5F15_rMdGMIDkrQ=w740)
5. What are your thoughts now on the first two questions?
