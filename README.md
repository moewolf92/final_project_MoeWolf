# final_project_MoeWolf

## Part 1

## [Outline] For this project, I decided to focus on how the hand you're dealt in life can affect your health. Specifically, I want to focus on the connection between obesity and poverty. If other data presents itself, such as smoking rates, I may include that later. I will then show the reader that the government needs to help people by making healthy choices easier and removing monetary incentives from companies that benefit from making our population unhealthy. Maps showing this correlation are on the shorthand preview I included below. I plan on creating maps that are more harmonious in order to show the realtionship more seamlessly. 

## [Data] I plan to use the United States Physical Activity and Obesity Prevalence by County 2001-2011 data from [Healthdata.org](http://ghdx.healthdata.org/record/ihme-data/united-states-physical-activity-and-obesity-prevalence-county-2001-2011) for the obesity measure and poverty status in the past twelve months data from [Census.gov](https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/download_center.xhtml)

## [Sketches & Medium] I plan to implement my final project by creating graphs showing the realtionship in various areas and talking about research that has shown that food deserts, low income, stresss, and the like can negatively affect your health. The majority of the work will be map data that I have pulled together from the aforementioned data sources though. I plan on presenting this over shorthand. I created a very brief mock-up here - [Shorthand Preview](https://preview.shorthand.com/7rNvL5A4Mob1zrmf)
