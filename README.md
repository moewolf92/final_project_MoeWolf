# final_project_MoeWolf

## Part 1

**Outline** For this project, I decided to focus on how the hand you're dealt in life can affect your health. Specifically, I want to focus on the connection between obesity and poverty. If other data presents itself, such as smoking rates, I may include that later. I will then show the reader that the government needs to help people by making healthy choices easier and removing monetary incentives from companies that benefit from making our population unhealthy. Maps showing this correlation are on the shorthand preview I included below. I plan on creating maps that are more harmonious in order to show the realtionship more seamlessly. 

 **Data** I plan to use the United States Physical Activity and Obesity Prevalence by County 2001-2011 data from [Healthdata.org](http://ghdx.healthdata.org/record/ihme-data/united-states-physical-activity-and-obesity-prevalence-county-2001-2011) for the obesity measure and poverty status in the past twelve months data from [Census.gov](https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/download_center.xhtml)

**Sketches & Medium** I plan to implement my final project by creating graphs showing the realtionship in various areas and talking about research that has shown that food deserts, low income, stresss, and the like can negatively affect your health. The majority of the work will be map data that I have pulled together from the aforementioned data sources though. I plan on presenting this over shorthand. I created a very brief mock-up here - [Shorthand Preview](https://preview.shorthand.com/7rNvL5A4Mob1zrmf)

## Part 2

I continued to pursue this story, but I found better data to support it at [DataUSA.io](Copy of Data USA Cart.csv). 
I originally intended to tell this story through various maps, the data was all aggregated on the county level, so that kind of just made sense to me. However, after fiddling around with it for a while, I asked some people how it looked, and realized that it wasn't as descriptive as I imagined it would be. Here is an example of a [map](Map.pdf) I made at this stage. It's a little too cluttered and the relationships just don't stand out. 

For some background, I am essentially taking a look at Social Determinants of Health (SDoH), a hot topic in healthcare right now. My approach is that healthcare professionals aren't as considerate of these determinants as they could/shoudl be, and showing them how the system is stackced against those who are less fortunate sets them at a disadvantage. I will then incorperate some strategies to help healthcare professionals help their patients overcome these issues. 

### User Research Protocol: 
* target audience I hope to reach
  * Healthcare Professionals
* Approach to identifying representative individuals to interview
  * Talk to doctors, nurses, and other healthcare professionals I know
* Interview script/findings

I created a [Google Form](https://forms.gle/G5bwPHUaoP8Z5A6QA) for my interview subjects to fill out. The questions were as follows:
1. Why do you think poor people or minorities in the US are out of shape or have lifestyle diseases (heart conditions, lung disease, diabetes, etc)?
2. Do you think these people bear responsibility for the health conditions they have?
3. Do you understand these graphs? What do you like/not like about them?

5. What are your thoughts now on the first two questions?

**Responses**

1. Why do you think poor people or minorities in the US are out of shape or have lifestyle diseases (heart conditions, lung disease, diabetes, etc)?
>Hard to find motivation to work out


>Systemic racism, capitalism exploiting working-class people, tax reforms that benefit the wealthy and not the middle-class or poor, dairy/poultry/meat subsidies that make those foods cheap instead of fruits/vegetables, lack of access to healthy diet/exercise.


>I feel a major contributor is overeating and especially the heavily-processed foods many of us eat. I think if you replace clearly defined, punctuated meals with constant snacking, I think it makes sense that people eat too much. The industry has become masterful in 
creating foods that their consumers crave. Pairing a snacking habit with a snack that can't be put down is a recipe for disaster.


2. Do you think these people bear responsibility for the health conditions they have?
>Not complete, I think their circumstance and where they live have a piece to play in it


>No, they are exploited by this system.


>No, people do not bear complete responsibility for these conditions. In general, people are not well educated about nutrition. Time and time again, the processed foods industry has made windfalls by propagating health claims like "low fat" or "low sugar," alternating their focus based on what consumers fear the most at the moment. The whole picture is important, but the industry doesn't want people to focus on whether their foods can realistically be part of a healthy diet.


3. Do you understand these graphs? What do you like/not like about them?
**Graph 1**
>This one is great! Very clear.


>I understand the x-axis and y-axis values. I wish I understood what the different shades of blue represent?


>Yes, I can make sense of this graph. It points to a potential relationship between poverty and obesity. There appears to be a positive correlation, but it's not clear to me how strong it is. I like the color-scheme of the graph and the hollow circles. I think it's designed well, but I feel the labels are too small. Event in a pdf, it's a little hard to read. Also, it's not clear what is being plotted. Is each circle a city? County? Census tract?


**Graph 2**
>I like this one!


>I still don't know the different shades of blue.


>I think my above comments apply here too. I like the graph and think it's well designed. I'm not sure how I feel about the blue panel on the x-axis, maybe just leave it white? I just went back and read the captions for both graphs, but I'm still not sure what each circle is. I think a little context could be added to the caption too!


4. Do you understand this story outline? What do you like/not like about it? 
>Love this story, very clear and fun to read


>Yes, 8-11 feels easier said than done.


>This is pretty cool! I feel it flows well, and I get it. Here are a few specific comments:
>
>I think you could add a pane before 5 to explain the general point you're making. Then the current 5 could serve as a great example. Also, from context, I think this is directed to physicians. So I would think carefully about what I'm asking them to do. Could the last three panes relate more closely to the issues you've raised earlier? This is about how the environment shapes our health right, so maybe one specific thing is just for the physician to educate the patient on the key stats. Like you're pitching that physicians act like epidemiologists for a minute. I'm not sure if that makes sense, it's just one idea.


5. What are your thoughts now on the first two questions

>Still the same but with more information now. Easy to see with these pictures why and how people become the way that they are


>The scatter plots are fine, I just need a legend.


>I feel more informed on the role of environment in our health. I think there are so many things to consider when discussing these questions. I was focused on the processed-foods industry, but of course, the things you pointed to are important. It's so hard to eat well if you are poor. Or rather, eating well becomes infinitely more possible if you are upper middle class or better.
>The story map was great because I love thinking about things as a story. Regarding the graphs, I feel the trends aren't crystal clear, so it may help to add some numbers or analysis to say, there's a correlation of X or something like that.
>Nice!


### Plan for redoing graphs and storyboard

For the graphs, I plan on using a different software. I tried out Tableau, but it was a mess and took me forever to clean my data in sucha  way that it would accept it and graph out the data appropriately. In the end, the visualizations I made were sub-par. Given how much people like the software, I suspect it's my lack of familiarity with it that is the main issue. given that, if I have time this coming week to improve my Tableau skills enought ot create nice visuals, I might attempt it again, but that seems unlikely. 

Most of the issues seemed to be the labeling, which I intend to make clearer. I was so focused on using that software that I forgot about the substance of the graphs. I will also be making the dots solid and play with the size, so that they look like individual dots of the same color, since one reviewer thought there were different collored dots (there weren't). 

For the story, I will be working on the speicifc wording, but that part seemed a lot better. Most of the issues seemed to arrive in the solution I presented, which are the solutions that I learned about through classes, conferences, and books on the matter. I'll do more in-depth research on proven solutions to these issues, and incorperate those as well. 

I will continue to use shorthand, as it seems to have a pretty simple interface and the ways it delivers graphis will work well with my story.
